⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Neglecting User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI)
- Focusing solely on functionality without considering intuitive design and ease of use leads to poor user engagement
- Ignoring Performance Optimization: Slow loading times, memory leaks, and inefficient resource management can frustrate users and lead to uninstalls.
- Inadequate Testing: Rushing or skipping thorough testing across various devices, Android versions, and network conditions results in bugs and crashes.
- Overloading with Features: Attempting to include too many features can lead to a bloated, complex app that is difficult to navigate and maintain. Focus on core functionalities first.
- Poor Security Implementation: Neglecting security measures can expose user data and compromise app integrity. Security should be a priority from the outset.
- Performing heavy operations on the main thread leads to unresponsive apps and Application Not Responding (ANR) errors.
- Failing to optimize app metadata, keywords, and descriptions limits discoverability in the Google Play Store.
- Failing to implement robust error handling can lead to unexpected crashes and a poor user experience.
- Apps require ongoing maintenance, bug fixes, and feature updates to remain relevant and functional.
