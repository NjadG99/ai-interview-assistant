💡 Tips for IBM India
- Use platforms such as freeCodeCamp, The Odin Project, W3Schools, and Udemy to learn or refresh your skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks.
- Build a portfolio of web development projects to showcase your practical skills. For instance, a simple full-stack project can demonstrate both front-end and back-end knowledge.
- Brush up on Core Java and frameworks like Spring Boot, which are frequently mentioned in HCL job descriptions.
- Be prepared to discuss projects listed on your resume, the technologies used, and the challenges you faced. You may also be given live coding problems or asked scenario-based questions.
- HR Interview: This round evaluates your soft skills, cultural fit, and motivation. Common questions include "Tell me about yourself," "Why HCL?," and discussions on your strengths and weaknesses. 
- The test typically includes a few programming questions. Practice your coding skills on common problems related to data structures and algorithms. 
- Aptitude: Practice quantitative ability (e.g., time and work, percentages), logical reasoning (e.g., puzzles, series), and verbal ability.
- Understand how to optimize page load times and ensure a smooth user experience. This includes techniques like code minification, image optimization, and caching.
- Learn to build and work with RESTful APIs, understanding HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and protocols. 
- Study SQL and NoSQL databases. For SQL, practice writing complex queries involving joins and subqueries, and understand concepts like normalization and transactions. For NoSQL, familiarize yourself with databases like MongoDB.

- Neglecting clean and maintainable code: In a team environment, writing "spaghetti code" is a major mistake. It makes the codebase difficult to debug, scale, and maintain. Use proper naming conventions, logical file organization, and modularize your code into reusable components.

- Reinventing the wheel: Avoid writing your own solutions for problems that have well-established, open-source libraries. This increases development time and introduces more potential for bugs. Use existing, tested libraries and frameworks instead.

- Improper version control: Frequent, well-documented commits are essential for team collaboration. Mistakes like infrequent commits, working directly on the main branch, or ignoring merge conflicts can lead to lost work and code instability.

- Assuming code is bug-free: Even if your program compiles without errors, you should never assume it is bug-free. Proper testing, including unit, integration, and edge-case testing, is necessary to catch issues before they reach production.

- Overlooking performance optimization: Slow-loading websites can negatively impact user engagement and SEO. Optimize images, minify CSS and JavaScript files, and use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to reduce latency.
