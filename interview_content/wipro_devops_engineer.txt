💡 Tips
- Be prepared to explain key DevOps principles and practices, including the importance of collaboration, continuous feedback, and "shifting left" to fix issues earlier in the development process.
- Understand the entire DevOps lifecycle and the purpose of different tool categories:
- Continuous integration (CI): Tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI.
- Continuous delivery/deployment (CD): Automating application deployments and understanding the difference between CD and CI.
- Monitoring and logging: Using tools like Splunk, Dynatrace, Prometheus, and Grafana to track application performance, availability, and issues.
- Practice root cause analysis and be ready to discuss how you would troubleshoot deployment failures or system outages.
- Master the use of Git, including common branching strategies. Wipro often uses GitHub and Bitbucket.
- A strong command of Linux is essential, as most applications run on these systems. Practice using basic commands and writing shell scripts for automation.
- Understand core networking concepts like TCP/IP, DNS, firewalls, and load balancers.
- Design and manage pipelines using GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps.

						⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Neglecting the "Ops" side. Focusing too heavily on development and ignoring the operational realities can lead to difficult-to-maintain and unstable production systems.
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wB2OpH3PoKY
- Treating DevOps as just a set of tools. A common mistake is believing that simply acquiring and implementing DevOps tools like Jenkins, Kubernetes, or Terraform is sufficient.

- Poor communication and collaboration. DevOps is meant to break down silos between development, operations, and security teams. Failing to communicate effectively with other departments can lead to misaligned goals, friction, and delays.
