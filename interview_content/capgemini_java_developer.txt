📌 Interview Questions + Answers
1. Q: What is Java as a programming language?
   A: Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language used for building platform-independent applications.

2. Q: Using Java 8, write code to print even numbers from an array and calculate the sum of the even numbers.
   A: Java 8 provides streams to filter even numbers from an array and calculate their sum efficiently.
      Use Streams: Java 8 introduced streams, which allow for functional-style operations on collections.

3. Q: Explain the purpose of dependency injection in Angular.
   A: Dependency injection is a design pattern used to implement IoC, allowing for better modularity and easier testing in Angular applications.

4. Q: What is a ConcurrentHashMap in Java?
   A: ConcurrentHashMap is a thread-safe variant of HashMap that allows concurrent access and updates without locking the entire map.

5. Q: What improvements to interfaces were introduced in Java 8 that were missing in Java 7, specifically regarding static and default methods?
   A: Java 8 introduced static and default methods in interfaces, allowing for method implementation and code reusability.
Java 8 introduced static methods in interfaces, allowing for method implementation directly in the interface itself.

Default methods were also introduced in Java 8, enabling interfaces to have method implementations without affecting implementing classes.

Static methods in interfaces can be called using the interface name, while default methods can be overridden by implementing classes.

6. Q: Explain internal working of HashMap ? How to synchronize it ?
   A: HashMap is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and uses hashing to efficiently retrieve values.

7. Q: How to use a jetty server in your spring boot application ?
   A: To use a Jetty server in a Spring Boot application, you can configure it as a dependency and customize its settings.

8. Q: What is a controller.
   A: A controller is a component in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern that handles user input and updates the model and view accordingly.

9. Q: What is hash collision.
   A: Hash collision occurs when two different inputs produce the same hash value. hashCode() and equals() methods are from Object class.

10.Q: Explain circuit breaker?
   A: Circuit breaker is a design pattern used to prevent cascading failures in distributed systems.
