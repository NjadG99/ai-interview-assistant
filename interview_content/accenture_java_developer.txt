📌 Interview Questions + Answers
1. Q: What is abstraction in Java?
   A: Data Abstraction is the property by virtue of which only the essential details are displayed to the user. We use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.

2. Q: What is Polymorphism?
   A: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take many forms. It allows performing the same action in many different ways. 

3. Q: What is runtime polymorphism or dynamic method dispatch?
   A: Runtime polymorphism or Dynamic Method Dispatch is a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than compile-time. It is called as through the reference variable of a superclass.

4. Q: What do you mean by an interface in Java?
   A: An interface in the Java programming language is an abstract type that is used to specify a behavior that classes must implement. It is a collection of abstract methods.

5. Q: What is the difference between abstract classes and interfaces?
   A: An abstract class allows creating functionality that subclasses can implement or override. An interface only allows defining functionality, not implementing it and whereas a class can extend only one abstract class, it can take advantage of multiple interfaces.

6. Q: What is inheritance in Java?
   A: Java Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class. When an “Is-A” relationship exists between two classes, we use Inheritance.

7. Q: Can you override a private or static method in Java?
   A: No, we cannot override private or static methods methods declared as private can never be overridden, they are in-fact bounded during compile time. 

8. Q: What is multiple inheritance? 
   A: Multiple Inheritance is a feature of object oriented concept, where a class can inherit properties of more than one parent class. 

9. Q: What is encapsulation in Java?
   A: Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates.

10.Q: What is composition in Java?
   A: Composition is a restricted form of Aggregation in which two entities are highly dependent on each other.
