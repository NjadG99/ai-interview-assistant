💡 Tips
- Learn to style web pages using CSS3. A key skill is responsive web design, which is often implemented using media queries to ensure your pages look good on all devices.
- As a core web language, a solid understanding of JavaScript is required. This includes the basics of the language, but also more advanced topics that might come up in a technical interview.
- JSON and XML: These data formats are fundamental for modern web applications. Study how to parse and manipulate them. 
- Study common Accenture coding questions and solutions to prepare for the technical coding assessment. Websites like Great Learning offer lists of past questions.
- Many online resources offer practice interviews and curated problem lists to help you prepare for the technical interview portion of the hiring process.
-  Learn about the agile approach to software development, which is used at Accenture. This includes iterative development, regular feedback, and incremental feature releases. 
- Accenture's technical assessment includes a section on pseudocode, which tests your understanding of programming logic, loops, recursion, and basic data structures.
- Practice basics like input/output, conditional looping, arrays, and functions in your language of choice (Java, Python, C++, etc.).
- Learn to style web pages using CSS3. A key skill is responsive web design, which is often implemented using media queries to ensure your pages look good on all devices.
- Master the basic structure of an HTML document, semantic HTML5 tags (<section>, <article>, etc.), and accessibility best practices.

						
⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Neglecting planning and over-engineering: Jumping straight into code without a clear blueprint can lead to convoluted layouts that baffle users and hinder functionality.
- Poor performance optimization: Failing to compress media, minify code, and use modern caching techniques results in slow-loading websites and high bounce rates.
- Ignoring web accessibility and responsiveness: With so much traffic coming from mobile devices, a non-responsive design is a critical error.
- Inadequate security measures: Insufficiently sanitizing user input and overlooking common vulnerabilities like SQL injection can leave a project open to attacks.
- Writing non-readable code: As part of a larger team, writing "spaghetti code" that is difficult to maintain and debug is a major issue.
- Not developing for different screen sizes: Assuming that an application will work the same across all devices is a mistake.
- Rushing to code without understanding: In coding assessments, avoid the temptation to start coding immediately.
- Lack of communication: Silence during a coding interview is often seen as a red flag. Interviewers want to understand your thought process.
- Giving too much or too little detail: When answering questions, gauge the interviewer's expectations.
- Lying on your resume: Providing false or exaggerated information about your skills and experience can have a serious negative impact if you get caught during a technical or background check.
