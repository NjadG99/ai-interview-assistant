📌 Interview Questions + Answers
    
1. Q: what is Android? 
   A: Android is a Linux-based, open-sourced operating system commonly found on mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets. It’s a kernel-based system that gives developers the flexibility to design and deploy simple and/or advanced apps.

2. Q: What is the current version of Android, and how old is it?
   A: The current version of Android is 9.0, also called Android Pie, and it came out in August of 2018.

3. Q: What database is used for the Android platform?
   A: SQLite, an open-source, self-contained, serverless database, is embedded in Android by default.

4. Q: Can you change an application’s name after you have deployed it?
   A: Although you CAN change it, the real question should be “SHOULD you”? Changing an application’s name risks breaking some of its functionality.

5. Q: Explain the Android SDK.
   A: This is a set of tools that Android developers use in order to develop or write apps. It features a graphical user interface that emulates a handheld, Android-driven environment, making it easier for developers to create, test, and debug their code.

6. Q: Speaking of emulators, why is it so important for developers to have access to one?
   A: Since emulators function like an actual hand-held device, developers have a good dedicated “sandbox” to safely create, edit, test, and debug new applications, seeing how they would function on a real device without having to actually risk a real device.

7. Q: What languages does Android use?
   A: Android-primarily uses Java, but it also supports C/C++, which, if used with Android SDK, will run faster.

8. Q: What’s an intent in the context of Android? Describe the different types.
   A: Much what it sounds like, it’s the intention to perform an action, a message that is passed between components. Intents request actions from a different component, such as sending an email, opening a web page, or launch a given activity.
 
9. Q: Explain Android Toast.
   A: Toast, in this case, is a pop-up box (hence the word) giving feedback regarding an operation that the users initiated, informing the user of the current status of said operation.

10.Q: What’s a content provider?
   A: Content providers share information between different Android applications. They allow users to access data within an application. Examples include contact information, images, video, and audio.
