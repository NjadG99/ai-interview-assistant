=== TCS – java Developer ===

📌 Interview Questions + Answers
    
1. Q: Why do you want to join TCS?
   A: I want to join TCS for its innovative projects, growth opportunities, and commitment to employee development in a dynamic work environment.

2. Q: What is multithreading?
   A: Multithreading is a programming technique that allows concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single process.

3. Q: How do you determine if a tree is sum balanced?
   A: A sum-balanced tree is a binary tree where the sum of values in the left subtree equals the sum in the right subtree.

4. Q: Describe the key principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in ABAP and provide examples of how they are applied.
   A: OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm based on objects and classes, promoting code reusability and modularity.

      Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within one unit (class). Example: A class 'Car' with properties like 'color' and methods like 'drive()'.

      Inheritance: Mechanism to create a new class from an existing class, inheriting its properties and methods.

5. Q: Explain the concepts of OOP.
   A: OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm based on objects that encapsulate data and behavior.

Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within one unit (e.g., a class).

Inheritance: Mechanism to create a new class from an existing class, inheriting its properties (e.g., a 'Dog' class inheriting from an 'Animal' class).

Polymorphism: Ability to present the same interface for different underlying forms (e.g., method overloading and overriding).


6. Q: What is Java?
   A: ava is a versatile, object-oriented programming language used for building platform-independent applications.

7. Q: Explain the concept of a 'Collection' interface in Java
   A: Collections in Java are frameworks that provide a way to store and manipulate groups of objects.

8. Q: Describe the difference between an object and a class in Java.
   A: Class defines properties and methods; for example, 'Car' class with attributes like 'color' and 'model'.
      Object is a specific instance of a class; for example, 'myCar' is an object of the 'Car' class.

9. Q: What is the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)?
   A: The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a software-based engine that runs Java programs. It is part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and serves as an abstract computing machine that enables a computer to run a Java program.

10.Q: Why is Java a Platform-Independent Language?
   A: Java is platform-independent at the source code and bytecode level, meaning the same Java program can run on any device that has a compatible JVM.

⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Common mistakes for TCS Java developers include poor exception handling, neglecting input validation and security, misusing static variables and concurrency, inefficiently handling memory and performance.
- Incorrectly using try-catch blocks or swallowing exceptions with empty blocks can lead to resource leaks and unstable applications. 
- Trying to use an uninitialized object reference can be avoided by initializing objects before use or utilizing the Optional class. 
- Overusing static members can lead to tight coupling, making code harder to test and maintain. 
- Overlooking security can lead to SQL injection and other attacks; always validate and sanitize user input and implement robust authentication and authorization. 
- kipping unit and integration tests can result in unreliable code; use tools like JUnit and TestNG for robust testing. 
- Failing to validate and sanitize user input creates security risks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). 
- The tech landscape evolves quickly; failing to learn new features, languages, and frameworks can lead to obsolescence.
