7. Q: What do you mean by deadlock in OS?
   A: In Operating Systems, a deadlock is a situation where a set of two or more processes are blocked forever, each waiting for a resource that is held by the other.

8. Q: What are the core components of an Android app?
   A: The fundamental building blocks are:

Activities

Services

Broadcast Receivers

Content Providers

Fragments

Intents

Views

9. Q: Explain Android activity lifecycle.
   A: An Activity starts with onCreate(), then onStart(), onResume().

When moving out of the foreground: onPause(), onStop().

If the activity returns, onRestart() → onStart() → onResume().

If destroyed: onDestroy().
Discuss how configuration changes (like orientation) may cause restart etc.

10.Q: What is null safety in Kotlin?
   A: n Kotlin, types are non‑nullable by default. If you want a variable to hold null, you declare it with ?

⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid
- https://www.digittrix.com/blogs/common-errors-to-avoid-in-android-app-development
- https://decode.agency/article/android-app-development-mistakes/
-Neglecting a solid app architecture. A poor or non-existent architecture like MVVM or Clean Architecture leads to tightly coupled, buggy, and difficult-to-maintain code. Instead, use Android Jetpack libraries such as ViewModel and LiveData for better scalability and testability.
- Blocking the main thread. Executing long-running tasks like network calls or database operations on the main thread causes the app to become unresponsive and can trigger "Application Not Responding" (ANR) errors.

- Mismanaging the Android lifecycle. Improperly handling lifecycle events can cause memory leaks and crashes

-Hardcoding strings and values. Storing text, dimensions, and colors directly in code makes the app difficult to localize, maintain, and adapt to different themes and screen sizes.
