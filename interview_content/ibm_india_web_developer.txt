⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Jumping into coding without a clear plan, leading to a disorganized and inefficient development process.
- Writing messy, non-semantic HTML and CSS, using inconsistent naming conventions, and failing to adhere to coding standards.
- Ignoring security best practices.
- Skipping testing or only performing basic testing, leading to bugs and issues in the live application. 
- Building applications that cannot handle increased traffic or data volume, leading to performance issues or system failures.
- Failing to document code, APIs, and the overall application architecture, making it difficult for others to understand and maintain the code.
- Failing to keep up with the latest technologies, tools, and security best practices, leading to outdated and potentially vulnerable applications.
- Forgetting to catch and handle errors in API calls.
- Using console.log() for debugging but never implementing real error handling.
- Using inefficient algorithms or unnecessary re-renders in React.
