4. Q: What are React hooks?
   A: React Hooks are functions introduced in React 16.8 that let you use state, lifecycle methods, and other React features in functional components—without writing a class.

5. Q: What is prop drilling and how do you avoid it?
   A: Prop drilling refers to the process of passing props through multiple intermediate components that do not need them, just to get the data to a deeply nested child component.

6. Q: How do you manage state in large applications?
   A: Managing state in large apps involves organizing data efficiently, minimizing prop drilling, and ensuring predictable, scalable updates. 

7. Q: What are the differences between <div> and <span> elements?
   A: <div> and <span> are two of the most commonly used HTML elements, but they serve different purposes and behave differently.

8. Q: Explain CSS selectors?
