📌 Interview Questions + Answers
1. Q: Compare between Java and Python.
   A: Java is a statically typed and compiled language, and Python is a dynamically typed and interpreted language. This single difference makes Java faster at runtime and easier to debug, but Python is easier to use and easier to read.

2. Q: What is Python?
   A: Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language that is used to create user interface applications for web development (server side), software development, mathematics, operation and so on.

3. Q: What is the purpose of PYTHONPATH environment variable?
   A: PYTHONPATH is an environment variable which you can set to add additional directories where python will look for modules and packages. 

4. Q: Which data types are supported in Python?
   A: The basic data types in Python are Integers, Floating-Point Numbers, Complex Numbers, Strings, Boolean Type, Built-In Functions like Math.

5. Q: How is memory managed in Python?
   A: Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures. The management of this private heap is ensured internally by the Python memory manager.

6. Q: Explain Inheritance in Python with an example.
   A: Inheritance is a powerful feature in object oriented programming. It refers to defining a new class with little or no modification to an existing class. 

7. Q: What are the two major loop statements?
   A: The group of statements being executed repeatedly is called a loop. There are two loop statements in Python: for and while.

8. Q: Define generators in Python?
   A: A Python generator is a function that produces a sequence of results. It works by maintaining its local state, so that the function can resume again exactly where it left off when called subsequent times. 

9. Q: How do we reverse a list in Python?
   A: Reversing a list in-place with the list. reverse() method. Using the “ [::-1] ” list slicing trick to create a reversed copy. Creating a reverse iterator with the reversed() built-in function.

10.Q: What is a dictionary in Python?
   A: Python dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. It is mutable and can contain mixed types. The keys in a dictionary must be immutable objects like strings or numbers. They must also be unique within a dictionary.

💡 Tips
- Gain a strong understanding of Python's fundamental syntax, data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets), and object-oriented programming concepts like classes, inheritance, and encapsulation. 
- Use platforms like HackerRank, LeetCode, and CodeSignal to practice problems and familiarize yourself with the type of questions asked in coding tests. 
- Focus on the fundamentals of Data Structures and Algorithms, as these are crucial for coding rounds and problem-solving. 
- Be ready to discuss experience with cloud platforms (like Google Cloud Platform - GCP), containerization (Docker), and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. 
- Be familiar with popular Python libraries (e.g., Pandas) and frameworks for web development and data processing. 
- Practice coding and technical interviews to get comfortable with the process and format. 
- Frame your introduction to highlight your strongest skills and connect them to the job requirements. 
- Understand unit testing, participate in code reviews, and know how to use testing frameworks like Pytest and Behave. 
- If you don't know an answer, try to offer an educated guess or discuss alternative approaches. 
- During coding tests, start with questions you find easier to build confidence and manage your time wisely.

- https://www.shiksha.com/online-courses/articles/python-development-blunders-to-avoid/
- Using a broad except: clause, which can hide the true nature of an error. Another mistake is catching an exception and simply passing without any logging or handling.https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/16x5oun/what_mistakes_do_bad_python_developers_make/

- Inconsistent use of spacing, poor variable naming (e.g., using camelCase instead of snake_case), and ignoring line length limits.
- Defining a function like def add_to_list(item, my_list=[]):. Calling this function multiple times without providing a list will cause it to use the same list object each time.
