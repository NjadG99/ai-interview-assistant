=== TCS – DevOps engineer ===

📌 Interview Questions + Answers
    
1. Q: What is DevOps?
   A: A cultural and technical approach to merge development and operations, emphasizing collaboration and automation to shorten the software development lifecycle. 

2. Q: Explain Docker layering.
   A: Docker layering allows efficient image storage and reuse by stacking file system changes in layers.


3. Q: Explain the CI/CD pipeline.
   A: CI/CD pipeline automates software development processes, enabling continuous integration and delivery for faster, reliable releases.

4. Q: Write a Python syntax example.
   A: Python syntax is the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured programs in Python.

5. Q: What is nvm?
   A: NVM (Node Version Manager) is a tool for managing multiple Node.js versions on a single machine.

6. Q: What is the difference between IAAS, PAAS, and SAAS in AWS?
   A: IAAS, PAAS, and SAAS are cloud service models in AWS, differing in management levels and user control.
IAAS (Infrastructure as a Service): Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Example: Amazon EC2.

PAAS (Platform as a Service): Offers hardware and software tools over the internet, allowing developers to build applications. Example: AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

SAAS (Software as a Service): Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Example: Amazon WorkDocs.

7. Q: How do you ensure high availability in cloud computing?
   A: High availability in cloud computing ensures systems are operational and accessible with minimal downtime through redundancy and failover strategies.

8. Q: What are the best security practices in AWS cloud?
   A: Implementing best security practices in AWS is crucial for protecting data and resources in the cloud environment.

 
9. Q: How do you monitor and troubleshoot in Kubernetes?
   A: Effective monitoring and troubleshooting in Kubernetes involves using tools and practices to ensure application health and performance.

10.Q: What does a DevOps engineer do?
   A: DevOps engineers are responsible for bridging the gap between development and operations teams to streamline the software delivery process

⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid
- A significant error is viewing DevOps as a department or specific set of tools rather than a cultural shift that requires collaboration across all teams. 
- Poor Collaboration and Communication.
- Security cannot be an afterthought; it must be integrated into the DevOps pipeline from the beginning, a concept known as DevSecOps. 
- Focusing on Speed Over Quality.
- Discrepancies in development, testing, and production environments across teams can lead to unpredictable issues and deployment failures.
- Jumping straight into complex cloud platforms without understanding core concepts like virtualization, networking, and Linux is a common and damaging mistake. 
- Focusing on a specific tool (like Jenkins) instead of the underlying concept (like CI/CD) can make skills obsolete quickly. 
- Automating processes without a clear understanding of the underlying issues or objectives can perpetuate problems rather than solve them. 
- he technology landscape is constantly changing, and failing to stay updated with new tools and methodologies can lead to skill obsolescence.
- Neglecting to document processes, architectures, and lessons learned can hinder knowledge sharing and long-term understanding.
