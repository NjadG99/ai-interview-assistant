⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOJ9sBf3ahU
- Under-automating or automating the wrong tasks: Automation is a core tenet of DevOps. A common pitfall is to only automate parts of the CI/CD pipeline, leaving repetitive tasks like infrastructure provisioning or testing to manual processes.

- Neglecting continuous monitoring and feedback loops: Many engineers mistakenly think their job is done once the code is deployed.

- Overcomplicating the toolchain: New engineers might be tempted to add every new tool available, but a fragmented or overly complex toolchain can cause more problems than it solves.

- Failing to keep skills up-to-date: The DevOps landscape changes rapidly, and relying on outdated practices can make your systems more vulnerable and inefficient.
- Ignoring security until it's too late: Security is often an afterthought in the rush to deploy software quickly.
- Treating DevOps as a toolset, not a culture: A common mistake is to focus solely on implementing tools without fostering a cultural shift toward collaboration and shared responsibility.
