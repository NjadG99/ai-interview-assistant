📌 Interview Questions + Answers

1. Q: What is a Content Provider in Android?
   A: A Content Provider is a component in Android that manages access to a structured set of data.

2. Q: What is the MVVM design pattern and how does it work?
   A: MVVM is a design pattern that separates the UI, business logic, and data layers in an Android app.
      -MVVM stands for Model-View-ViewModel.
      -Model represents the data and business logic.
      -View is the UI component that displays the data.

3. Q: How does Retrofit work internally, and which design pattern does it follow?
   A: Retrofit is a type-safe HTTP client for Android that simplifies API calls using annotations like @GET and @POST. It follows the Builder pattern, supports converters like Gson for JSON parsing, handles async requests via Callbacks, and integrates with OkHttp for networking.

4. Q: What are Kotlin Coroutines?
   A: Kotlin Coroutines are a way to write asynchronous, non-blocking code in a sequential manner.

5. Q: Activity Lifecycle in Android.
   A: Activity Lifecycle in Android refers to the sequence of states an activity goes through during its lifetime.

6. Q: Scope functions in kotlin.
   A: Scope functions in Kotlin are functions that allow you to execute a block of code within the context of an object.

7. Q: LazyRow vs RecyclerView
   A: LazyRow is a Jetpack Compose component for displaying horizontally scrolling lists, while RecyclerView is a traditional Android view for displaying large data sets efficiently.

      -LazyRow is part of Jetpack Compose, RecyclerView is part of the Android framework
      -LazyRow is more declarative and easier to use for simple lists, RecyclerView is more powerful and customizable for complex lists

8. Q: What is difference between abstract class and interface?
   A: An abstract class can have both abstract and non-abstract methods, constructors, and instance variables. An interface only has abstract methods (until Java 8+, which allows default/static methods), no constructors, and no instance variables. A class can extend one abstract class but implement multiple interfaces.

9. Q: How do Kotlin Coroutines differ from Java threads?
   A: Coroutines are lightweight, non-blocking, scoped via CoroutineScope and Dispatchers; threads are heavy and may block UI if misused

10.Q: How do you implement DI in Android?
   A: Use Hilt to inject ViewModel, Repository, manage scopes with @Singleton, @Module, @Provides annotations

⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Skipping well-defined architectures like MVVM or MVP leads to unmaintainable, buggy, and difficult-to-scale codebases.
- Failing to manage screen rotations, keyboard visibility changes, or other configuration shifts can lead to crashes or data loss.
- Unreleased resources or improper use of Context can cause memory leaks, degrading performance and potentially leading to crashes.
- Performing long-running operations on the UI thread causes ANR (Application Not Responding) errors and a poor user experience.
- Not optimizing RecyclerView usage, such as improper view recycling or inefficient data updates, can lead to sluggish scrolling and performance issues.
- Lack of robust error handling can cause unexpected crashes, while neglecting security measures can expose user data and compromise the app's integrity.
- Adding too many unnecessary features can overwhelm users and make the app clunky and difficult to navigate.
- Failing to optimize app metadata (title, description, keywords) limits discoverability in app stores.
- Abandoning an app after launch without providing updates, bug fixes, or new features leads to user dissatisfaction and eventual decline in usage.
