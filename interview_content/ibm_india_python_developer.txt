=== IBM India – Python Developer ===

📌 Interview Questions + Answers
1. Q: What are the benefits of Python?
   A: Easier to learn, write and understand the code,Improved Productivity,Interpreted Language.

2. Q: What are the key features of Python?
   A: Easy to Code, Read
      Expressive, Free and Open-Source
      Portable, high-level language

3. Q: What type of language is Python? Programming or Scripting?
   A: Python is considered a scripting language because of a historical blur between scripting languages and general purpose programming languages.

4. Q: What is the difference between list and tuple in Python?
   A: The most important differences between list and tuple is that list is mutable, whereas a tuple is immutable.

5. Q: What are the global and local variables in Python?
   A: The scope of global variables is the entire program whereas the scope of local variables is limited to the function where it is defined.

6. Q: How memory management is done in Python?
   A:Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures.

7. Q: Which command is used to delete files in Python?
   A: In Python, you can use the os. remove() method to remove files, and the os. rmdir() method to delete an empty folder.

8. Q: Define slicing in Python?
   A: The slice() function returns a slice object. A slice object is used to specify how to slice a sequence.

9. Q: What are the built-in types available in Python?
   A: Python uses five numeric types: Booleans, integers, long integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers.

10.Q: How do you create a Python function?
   A: Function blocks begin with the keyword def followed by the function name and parentheses (( )).

- Practice designing small systems using classes.
- Even if you're not a DevOps engineer, learn: How to containerize Python apps using Docker
- Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for behavioral answers. 
- Visit IBM India’s careers page, read recent blogs, and understand their key domains (e.g., IBM Cloud, Watson AI). 
- Simulate the interview environment. Practice both: Live coding,Explaining your thought process.
- Follow PEP8 standards, handle exceptions gracefully, and write modular code.


						
⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Start coding without proper planning or outlining the project.
- Incorrect usage of an if statement.
- Unreadable code due to poor naming and lack of comments.
- Ignoring DevOps or Deployment Basics
- Writing non-modular, unreadable code
- Using hardcoded values or not handling exceptions
- Confusing mutable and immutable types (list vs tuple)
- Not understanding inheritance, polymorphism, or encapsulation
- Struggling with time/space complexity
- Running out of time due to unoptimized code
