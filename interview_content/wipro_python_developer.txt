📌 Interview Questions + Answers
1. Q: How can we make forms in Python?
   A: To make form in Python
      User can enter the details for username, password; and click on Login button. Once the button is clicked, a function is called to validate the credentials. Here, in this function, you have to write your business logic to validate the username and password.

2. Q: What are the benefits of Python?
   A: Easier to learn, write and understand the code – Python is really easy to pick up and learn similar to English language, so lot of people recommend Python to beginners

3. Q: What are the key features of Python?
   A: Easy to code and use
Free and Open Source
Object-Oriented and high level Language
GUI Programming Support
Extensible feature
Portable and Integrated language

4. Q: What type of language is Python? Programming or Scripting?
   A: Python is considered a scripting language because of a historical blur between scripting languages and general purpose programming languages. In fact, Python is not a scripting language, but a general purpose programming language that also works nicely as a scripting language. It is also an interpreted and high-level programming language for the purpose of general programming requirements.

5. Q: What are the applications of Python?
   A: Web and Internet Development.
Scientific and Numeric Applications.
Education and training programs.
Artificial intelligence and Machine learning.
Software and Game Development.
Business Application.

6. Q: What is the difference between list and tuple in Python?
   A: Lists and tuples are data structures in Python whereas the main difference is lists are mutable while tuples are immutable. A list has a variable size while a tuple has a fixed size.

7. Q: What are the global and local variables in Python?
   A: There are two types of variables: global variables and local variables. The scope of global variables is the entire program whereas the scope of local variable is limited to the function where it is defined.


8. Q: How can Python be an interpreted language?
   A: Python is called an interpreted language because it goes through an interpreter, which turns code you write into the language understood by your computer’s processor.

9. Q: What is a boolean in Python?
   A: The python data type bool is used to store two values i.e. True and False. Bool is used to test whether the result of an expression is true or false.

10.Q: What are the two major loop statements?
   A: The group of statements being executed repeatedly is called a loop. There are two loop statements in Python: for and while.

- If the role involves web development, understanding frameworks like Django or Flask, and concepts like HTTP, APIs, and databases (SQL, NoSQL).

						
⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Incorrect Indentation: Python relies on indentation for code blocks. Inconsistent or incorrect indentation leads to IndentationError and makes code difficult to read.
- Neglecting Code Readability: Writing cryptic or overly complex code without comments or clear variable names hinders understanding and maintenance.
- Not Using Docstrings: Failing to document functions, classes, and modules with docstrings makes it challenging for others (and your future self) to understand their purpose and usage.
- Inconsistent Naming Conventions: Not adhering to PEP 8 guidelines for variable, function, and class naming (e.g., snake_case for variables/functions, CamelCase for classes) reduces consistency.
- Not Handling Exceptions: Failing to implement try-except blocks for potential errors (like ZeroDivisionError, FileNotFoundError) can lead to program crashes.
- Overusing Global Variables: Excessive use of global variables can make code harder to reason about, test, and debug.
- Ignoring Computational Complexity: Not considering the time and space complexity of algorithms can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially with large datasets.
- Using Inefficient Data Structures: Choosing the wrong data structure for a task (e.g., using a list for frequent lookups instead of a dictionary or set) can impact performance.
- Hiding Errors: Catching broad exceptions without specific handling or logging can mask underlying issues, making debugging difficult.
- Modifying Lists While Iterating: Modifying a list while iterating over it can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs. Consider creating a new list or using list comprehensions.
