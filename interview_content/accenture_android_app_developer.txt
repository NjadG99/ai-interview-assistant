6. Q: What is action in Android?
   A: Actions are entry points into your app that define the invocation and discovery model for your app. You declare Actions in a JSON file called an Action package, which you eventually upload to your developer project when you want to test or submit your Actions project for the approval.

7. Q: What is an ANR notification in Android?
   A: ANR stands for Application Not Responding, which means that your app does not register events on the UI Thread anymore because a long running operation is executed there.

8. Q: Define the three key loops when monitoring an activity?

9. Q: Can two different Android apps share the same Linux ID?
   A: It’s possible to arrange for two apps to share the same Linux user ID, in which case they are able to access each other’s files. To conserve system resources, apps with the same user ID can also arrange to run in the same Linux process and share the same VM. The apps must also be signed with the same certificate.

10.Q: What’s DDMS?
   A: Android ships with a debugging tool called the Dalvik Debug Monitor Server, which provides port forwarding services, screen capture on the device, thread and heap information on the device, logcat, process, and radio state information, incoming call and SMS spoofing, location data spoofing, and more.

⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Blocking the main thread: Performing intensive operations like network requests, database queries, or heavy bitmap processing on the main (UI) thread causes "Application Not Responding" (ANR) errors and a poor user experience.
- Neglecting the Android lifecycle: Failing to manage the lifecycle of Activities and Fragments correctly can cause memory leaks and crashes, especially during configuration changes like screen rotations.
