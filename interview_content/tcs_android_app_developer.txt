📌 Interview Questions + Answers
    
1. Q: How do you share an Android project with a client?
   A: The project can be shared with the client through various methods such as email, cloud storage, or version control systems.

2. Q: Tell me about threads and how we can use them.
   A: Threads in Android allow concurrent execution of code, improving app performance and responsiveness.

3. Q: How do you find the smallest number in a list?
   A: To find the smallest number in a list, iterate through the list and keep track of the smallest number found so far.

4. Q: How do you check if a number is a palindrome?
   A: To check if a number is palindrome, reverse the number and compare it with the original number.

5. Q: How did you learn Android development?
   A: I learned Android through online courses, documentation, and practice.

6. Q: What are your CCTC and ECTC expectations?
   A: CCTC (Current City to Current City) and ECTC (Expected City to Current City) are terms used in job relocation discussions.

7. Q: What are the key components of Android architecture?
   A: Android architecture is structured in layers that work together to run Android applications. The main components are:
      a. Linux Kernel
      b. Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
      c. Android Runtime (ART)
      d. Native Libraries 
      e. Application Framework
      f. Applications

8. Q: What is a Sticky Intent? When Would You Use It?
   A: A sticky intent is an intent that persists even after it has been broadcast. When a new receiver registers for that intent, it receives the last broadcast immediately, without the intent being re-sent.
 
9. Q: How do you store data in Android?
   A: In Android, you can store data in several ways, depending on the type and scope of the data (e.g., small key-value pairs vs. complex structured data).

10.Q: How do you perform unit testing in Android
   A: Android provides multiple options to store data, depending on what you need (temporary, permanent, structured, unstructured, shared, etc.)

⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Common mistakes for TCS Android app developers to avoid include neglecting user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design, failing to implement robust testing and security.
- Prioritizing functionality over user-friendliness can lead to poor user adoption and retention. 
- Designing a mobile app that is just a scaled-down version of a website or desktop application can result in an unintuitive user experience. 
- Adding too many features can clutter the interface, confuse users, and increase development costs. 
- Skipping or rushing testing phases can lead to bugs and poor app quality upon release. 
- Inefficient handling of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) can lead to integration issues and errors. 
- Performing heavy operations on the main thread can cause the app to become unresponsive and crash. 
- Not providing regular updates and bug fixes leaves apps vulnerable and users dissatisfied.
