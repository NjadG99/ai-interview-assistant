⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Lack of Knowledge in Open Source Libraries
- Failing to explain OOP concepts clearly (Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Abstraction).
- Not knowing internal workings (e.g., how HashMap handles collisions or the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList).
- Memorizing lambda syntax without understanding how streams, functional interfaces, and method references work.
- Misusing try-catch blocks or misunderstanding checked vs unchecked exceptions.
- Relying on frameworks only and neglecting problem-solving skills.
- Using Spring Boot annotations blindly without understanding what they do (like @Autowired, @RestController, etc.).
- Not knowing how to write JOINs, use indexes, or normalize a database.
- Ignoring how components talk to each other or how an API request flows.
- Listing every technology but being unable to explain experience with it.
