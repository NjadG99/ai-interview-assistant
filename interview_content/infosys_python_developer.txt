📌 Interview Questions + Answers
1. Q: What is Python?
   A: Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language that is used to create user interface applications for web development.

2. Q: How do you set a global variable in a function?
   A: Normally, when you create a variable inside a function, that variable is local, and can only be used inside that function. To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.

3. Q: What are the rules for local and global variables in Python?
   A: In python, the variables referenced inside a function are global.
      When a variable is assigned new value anywhere in the body of a function then it is assumed as local.

4. Q: How can we create an empty class in Python?
   A: In Python, to write an empty class pass statement is used. Pass is a special statement in Python that does nothing. It only works as a dummy statement. 

5. Q: What are the key features of Python?
   A: Python is a dynamic, high level, free open source and interpreted programming language. It supports object-oriented programming as well as procedural oriented programming.

6. Q: How do I share global variables across modules?
   A: In the update.py file, we import the config.py module and modify the values of a and b . Similarly, in the main.py file, we import both config.py and update.py module. 

7. Q: How do we reverse a list in Python?
   A: Reversing a list in-place with the list. reverse() method. Using the “[::-1]” list slicing trick to create a reversed copy.

8. Q: Define slicing in Python?
   A: Python slicing is about obtaining a sub-string from the given string by slicing it respectively from start to end.

9. Q: How do you make a higher order function in Python?
   A: A higher-order function accepts one or more functions as input and returns a new function.

10.Q: How do I copy an object in Python?
   A: In Python, there are two ways to create copies:
        
        Deep copy
        Shallow copy

⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid
- overlooking proper exception handling, neglecting testing, writing unreadable code, and failing to understand data structures and their implications.
- Improperly managing memory, misusing data types, and making logical errors can hinder productivity and code quality.  
- Failing to implement robust error handling using try-except blocks can lead to unexpected program termination when encountering errors.
- Writing code without testing can result in bugs that are difficult to find and fix later. 
- Writing code that is difficult to understand can make it challenging to debug, maintain, and collaborate on.
- Python uses indentation to define code blocks. Mixing tabs and spaces or incorrect indentation can lead to syntax errors.
- Using the wrong data structure for a particular task can lead to performance issues or unexpected behavior.
- Not using version control (like Git) makes it difficult to track changes.
- Not managing memory properly can lead to performance issues or even memory leaks.
- Failing to consider edge cases can lead to unexpected errors.
