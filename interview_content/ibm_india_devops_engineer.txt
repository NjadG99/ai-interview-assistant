   A: DevOps is an extension of agile that focuses on practices for better software development and product delivery. 

2. Q: Explain the core concepts of DevOps?
   A: DevOps is a set of practices, principles, and cultural philosophies that aim to unify software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). 

3. Q: How does DevOps differ from traditional development models? 
   A: DevOps differs significantly from traditional development models in culture, process, and tooling. 

4. Q: What are the benefits of using a DevOps approach? 
   A: Using a DevOps approach provides a wide range of technical, cultural, and business benefits. 

5. Q: How do you measure the success of a DevOps implementation? 
   A: Measuring the success of a DevOps implementation involves tracking both technical performance and business outcomes.

6. Q: What is the role of SRE in a DevOps environment? 
   A: The role of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) in a DevOps environment is to bring software engineering principles to infrastructure and operations—helping ensure systems are scalable, reliable, and efficient while supporting the core goals of DevOps.

7. Q: Can we consider DevOps as Agile methodology?
   A: DevOps is an extension of agile built around the practices that are not in agile’s focus. When used together, both practices improve the software development and lead to better products

8. Q: Mention what the key aspects or principle behind DevOps are?
   A: To fuel a DevOps culture, we have to build robust tooling, also. That means investing up front in the five key areas: abstraction, composability, automation, orchestration, and idempotency.

9. Q: What are the core operations of DevOps?
   A: The core operations of DevOps are application development, code developing, code coverage, unit testing, etc.

10.Q: Explain which scripting language is most important for a DevOps engineer?
   A: Python. Most well-known language for programming and the first one that should be learnt, if someone wishes to become a DevOps professional.

💡 Tips for IBM India
- Understand IBM’s DevOps Stack
- Master the Right Tech Stack
- Build Real-World Projects (and showcase them)
- Focus on IBM-Specific Technologies
- Learn IBM's Culture & Interview Expectations
- Highlight tools used per project (e.g., "Implemented CI/CD with Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes on AWS")
- Use metrics: “Reduced deployment time by 60% using GitHub Actions and Ansible automation”
- Prioritize OpenShift, Terraform, CI/CD, and scripting
- Align your mindset to IBM’s collaborative, cloud-first culture
- Build and show end-to-end DevOps pipelines



						
⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Set up robust monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) 
- Lack of knowledge sharing and best practice.
- From CI/CD pipelines to infrastructure provisioning, automation reduces manual errors and accelerates delivery.
- Treat configurations as code and use Git to manage them, ensuring transparency and rollback capabilities.
- Foster open communication between developers and operations teams to resolve bottlenecks and align goals.
- Incorporate DevSecOps to ensure security is part of the development pipeline, not an afterthought.
- Use tools like Terraform or Ansible to make your infrastructure reproducible, version-controlled, and easier to scale.
- Underestimating the Importance of Soft Skills
- Failing to Keep Up with DevOps Tools and Technologies
- Disregarding the Culture Aspect of DevOps
