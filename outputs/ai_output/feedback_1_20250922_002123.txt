 Acknowledging your answer, I appreciate that you've shared your current academic focus. You did well in communicating your dedication to your field of study, which is important for an interview setting.

However, it would be more impactful if you could also share some context about yourself beyond your degree. For example, what motivated you to pursue computer science? What projects or experiences have you had that relate to this field? These details can help the interviewer better understand your background and passion for the industry.

To prepare for future interviews, try thinking about your unique experiences and achievements that make you a strong candidate for the position. I encourage you to practice sharing these stories confidently and authentically. Good luck with the rest of your interview!
