 Acknowledging your answer, I appreciate that you've shared your current academic focus. You did well by keeping it concise and relevant to the field of computer science. However, remember that interviewers also want to know about your experiences, achievements, and motivation beyond your degree. Try to prepare a more comprehensive response that includes your educational background, any relevant work experience or projects, and your career goals. This will help the interviewer understand your unique qualifications and why you're a strong candidate for the position. Keep practicing and good luck with the rest of the interview!
