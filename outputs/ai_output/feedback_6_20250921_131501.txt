 Acknowledging their answer: I see that you shared an experience where you were interrupted while trying to concentrate on something.

What they did well: It's great that you acknowledged the unexpected nature of the situation and how it caught you off guard.

Specific improvements: To make this response more effective, consider focusing on the actions you took in response to the interruption rather than just describing what happened. For instance, share how you reacted or how you managed to regain focus afterwards.

Actionable advice: In future interviews, try to prepare examples that showcase your problem-solving skills and resilience, particularly those where you successfully overcame a challenge. Remember, interviewers want to see how you think and respond under pressure. Keep practicing!
