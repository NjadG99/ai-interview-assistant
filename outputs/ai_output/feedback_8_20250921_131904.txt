 I see you've shared something written in Japanese in your answer. It's great that you're expressing curiosity and engagement with the interview process. However, given the interview is conducted in English, it might be more effective to ask questions related to the company or role in English for better communication and understanding. You could ask about the team dynamic, upcoming projects, or the company culture to show your interest and prepare yourself for potential employment. Keep up the enthusiasm!
