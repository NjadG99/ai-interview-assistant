 Acknowledging your answer, I appreciate that you've shared your current academic focus. You did well by keeping it concise and relevant to the topic of computer science. However, consider expanding on your background a bit more to give the interviewer a better understanding of who you are beyond your studies. For instance, you could mention any previous work experience, projects you've worked on, or extracurricular activities that demonstrate your skills and passion for computer science. Remember, the goal is to provide enough context so they have a solid foundation for assessing your fit within their team. Keep up the good work!
