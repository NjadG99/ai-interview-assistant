 Acknowledging your answer, I appreciate your emphasis on hard work. It's an admirable trait that many employers look for. However, it would be beneficial to provide specific examples of how your hard work has led to successful outcomes in past projects or roles. This not only shows the employer your work ethic but also demonstrates the impact of your efforts. Try preparing some stories from your professional experience that illustrate your dedication and the results you've achieved through it. Good luck with the rest of your interview!
