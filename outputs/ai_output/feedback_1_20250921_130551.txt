 Hi Tanme, I appreciate you sharing your name and current field of study with me. It's great that you're studying computer science as an engineering major. However, I'd recommend expanding on your answer by discussing your specific interests within computer science, any relevant projects or experiences you've had, and career goals that align with your studies. This will help the interviewer better understand your motivation and potential value to their team. Keep up the good work!
