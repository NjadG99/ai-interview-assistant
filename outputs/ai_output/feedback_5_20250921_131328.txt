 Acknowledging your answer briefly, I appreciate your focus on working for reputable companies. However, I'd suggest being more specific about the role and industry you see yourself in five years. Your enthusiasm stands out, so try to articulate how your skills and experiences align with that goal. For instance, you could mention a particular position or industry that excites you and explain why. This will help interviewers better understand your aspirations and commitment to professional growth. Keep up the positive attitude!
