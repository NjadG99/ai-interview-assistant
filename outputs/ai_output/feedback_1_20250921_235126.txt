 Acknowledging your answer, I appreciate that you've shared your current academic focus. You did well by providing a clear and concise response. However, remember that interviewers are also interested in understanding your experiences, achievements, and motivations beyond your educational background. To strengthen your response, try including a brief overview of your relevant projects, work experience (if any), or extracurricular activities. This will give interviewers a better sense of who you are as a candidate. Good luck with the rest of the interview!
