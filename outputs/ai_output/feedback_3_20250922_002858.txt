 Acknowledging their answer: I appreciate your honesty in sharing that. However, I'd like to remind you that interview questions are typically about your professional skills and experiences, not personal relationships.

What they did well: You showed a sense of self-awareness by acknowledging a weakness, even if it was misplaced in this context.

Suggesting improvements: Instead, consider discussing a professional weakness and how you're working to improve it. This will demonstrate your commitment to growth and development.

Actionable advice: Prepare some common interview questions and practice answering them with genuine examples of your strengths and weaknesses. Remember, the goal is to show how you can contribute positively to the team.
